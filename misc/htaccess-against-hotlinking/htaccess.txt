# htaccess template file to protect (full image) files from hotlinking
#
# Rename the file to .htaccess, enter your domain where indicated and place it for rexample
# within the root "albums" folder. 
# You can of course place it also in the root "uploaded" folder as well but you will not be 
# able to link directly to files for download then. 
#
# Generally you can also protect the cache folder but note that then search engines 
# will find no images from your site at all.
#
# If your server is properly configured it should work by default.
#
# NOTE: Also this might not protect someone to download full images once shown on your 
# Zenphoto gallery.
