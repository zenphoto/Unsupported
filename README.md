Unsupported Zenphoto scripts

The scripts found here are a collection of enhancements to Zenphoto that are not directly suported by the Zenphoto team.

Plugins are folders found in the "plugins" folder. They would be placed in the "plugins" folder of your installation. Note that what should be copied is the content of the folder. This will typically be a PHP script and a like-named folder with other content. The PHP script needs to be in the root of the "plugins" folder.

The folders in the "themes" folder are third party themes that are not hosted by the theme developer. Place the folder and its contents into your installation "themes" folder.

You will find miscellaneous other folders for extensions that do not fit the above categories. Readme files or script comments will describe their use.

Please remember that these scripts are provided for your use and education but are not supported by the Zenphoto team. This is true even if a team member originally created them.
