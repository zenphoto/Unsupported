Plugins
-------

Plugins are folders found in the `plugins` folder. They would be placed in the `plugins` folder of your installation. 

Note that what should be copied is the content of the folder. This will typically be a PHP script and a like-named folder with other content. The PHP script needs to be in the root of the "plugins" folder.

These plugins are also listed on our site's themes section:
